This document is a collection of notes taken by some students for the course of Cryptography held by prof. Daniele Venturi, Sapienza University of Rome.

Currently, the document is split as the cryptography lessons themselves, to preserve the original course timeline; most lesson files do keep a comment with the date.

I am one of the contributors too; also, I have added the cover and this reminder, and I have compiled the document again with \ConTeXt.
