This repo contains utils for class [1047622](http://danieleventuri.altervista.org/crypto1920.shtml) (prof. D. Venturi).

In particular it includes my solutions to:

* homework 1 & 2
* some previous exam
* some exercises of *Cryptography in Wonderland*

You can find the compiled pdf files on the [output branch](https://github.com/lrusso96/Cryptography/tree/output).

Alternatively, you can compile the project yourself.
